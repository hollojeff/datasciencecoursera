This folder contains:

Data_Analysis.R - This is the script which loads in the data (found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). This merges the test and training sets, applies the labels to the appropriate columns, extracts the means and standard deviations, and creates a new dataset, which contains the averages of each activity and subject.

Codebook.md - Contains the steps to transform the data, and the variables used for it.

Average_Data.txt - the output from the R script.
